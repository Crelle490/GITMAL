    "### About Anaconda Package Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda comes with two different package managers: `conda` and `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `conda` is the prefered package manager, that will check new package installation for compability with existing packages. While this pre-compability-check is nice in theory, it often turns out, that it becomes impossible to install a given package due to incompabilities with one or more other packages. Even more annoing, the simple install of a package may take hours to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pip` is a simpler package mangager, that comes with most Python distributions. It does none of the compability-checks when installing; it just installs whatever you ask it to (and incompabilites may then creep in in the run-time enviroment).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally you would try to install whatever you need via `conda` and when it breaks down due to to many broken dependencies (trying with 'flexible solve' etc. for hours), you just continue with `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### installing Keras via CONDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras will not install under Anaconda version 2021.11. It ends up in a endless package-conflict, when installing under `conda`.\n",

    "\n",
    "(This is a new finding for the particular version 2021.11, and previous version did not have this tensorflow install problem, but typically only a Keras install problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "The root-cause of the problem must be missing check when packageing the Anaconda, failing to find the set of conflicts we see, when installing `tensorflow` in the set of default installe packages that comes with the Anaconda distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Prepare and Ceate a new Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one solution is to create a new conda environment, and from this install `scikit-learn` and `tensorflow` and `keras`,\n",
    "\n",
    "Later we need a package called `nb_conda_kernels`, let us install this before we create and activate the new enviroment\n",

    "(base)> conda install nb_conda_kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2) Install Needed Packages \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we got a clean state enviroment and we need to install the packages needed for `scikit-learn` and  `tensorflow`, but this is as easy as\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that the package `nb_conda_kernels` also needs to be installed in this new enviroment, and it actually also installes the jupyter notebook packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Launching Jupyter-Notebooks in the new Enviroment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two `keras` interfaces, the stand-alone `keras`, and then a similar interface already build into `tensorflow.keras`. You could use both, but direct access via the stand-alone inteface may be the most obvious.\n",
